pi-node-synth
=============

An experiment playing linux synth sounds from a web server.

### Setup:
* Get nodejs
* sudo apt-get install sox
* sudo apt-get install build-essential
* sudo npm install -g node-gyp
* npm install
* npm start
* http://localhost:3000/ (refresh for more instruments)

The drum sampler requiers some drum sample audio files. They are not included, so substitute them with your own samples.
